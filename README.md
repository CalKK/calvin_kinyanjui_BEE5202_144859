## Project Objectives

1. **To develop a physics-based Digital Twin** for simulating 100 electric motorcycle fleet operations on a real Nairobi route, incorporating GPX topography, electrochemical battery degradation, and Monte Carlo stochastic trip generation.

2. **To compare the techno-economic viability of Sodium-Ion (SIB) and Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery chemistries** across cost, SOH degradation, energy efficiency, and capacity fade under identical operating conditions.

3. **To evaluate Owned (Depot Charging) versus Battery-as-a-Service (Swapping) business models** by quantifying Total Cost of Ownership per kilometre and identifying crossover points where one model becomes more cost-effective than the other.

4. **To deliver an interactive, data-driven decision-support tool** built in Streamlit, featuring configurable parameters, downloadable ETL data, automated feasibility reporting, and transparent mathematical derivations from first principles.

## Overview

A **Monte Carlo fleet simulation** tool that models **100 electric motorcycle (e-bike) riders** (25 per model × 4 models) over a configurable feasibility window (40 / 80 / 120 days) in Nairobi, Kenya. The tool enables fleet operators to compare the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** across four business models spanning two battery chemistries:

| Model | Chemistry | Ownership | Bikes | OPEX Driver |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **SIB Owned** | Sodium-Ion Battery | Fleet purchases battery | 25 | KPLC grid tariff (KSh/kWh) |
| **LFP Owned** | Lithium Iron Phosphate | Fleet purchases battery | 25 | KPLC grid tariff (KSh/kWh) |
| **SIB BaaS** | Sodium-Ion Battery | Operator-owned (swap) | 25 | Per-swap fee (KSh) |
| **LFP BaaS** | Lithium Iron Phosphate | Operator-owned (swap) | 25 | Per-swap fee (KSh) |

### Key Engineering Models

- **Pre-computed Algebraic Energy Decomposition** — Route energy is decomposed into `E(r_dyn) = A + B·r_dyn + C`, enabling ~1000x faster simulation by replacing per-trip array operations with scalar arithmetic.
- **Power-Law SOH Degradation** — `SOH_loss = k × EFC^p` where `k` is extracted from BMS data and `p` = 0.55 (SIB) / 0.50 (LFP).
- **Arrhenius Thermal Stress** — Battery degradation rate scales with ambient temperature: `k_thermal = k_base × 2^((T - 25) / 10)`.
- **Subspace System Identification (SSI)** — Dynamic internal resistance increases as SOH degrades: `r_dyn = R₀ × (1 + 2.5 × (1 - SOH))`.
- **CAPEX Amortization (Capped)** — `CAPEX_amortized = min(CAPEX_initial, CAPEX_initial × (1 - SOH) / 0.20)` — capped at the battery's purchase price (100% consumed at 80% SOH End-of-Life).
- **Stochastic Range Anxiety** — BaaS riders swap batteries at randomised SOC thresholds `θ ~ Uniform(min%, max%)`, simulating real-world behavioural uncertainty across the 25-bike fleet.

## Feasibility Report

After simulation, the app generates an automated **📋 Feasibility Report** containing:

### ⚖️ Head-to-Head Comparison Table

SIB vs LFP across 6 metrics (TCO owned, TCO BaaS, SOH, SOH loss, Wh/km, remaining Ah) with a ✅ winner column.

### 📝 Recommendations (5 sections)

1. **Cost Efficiency (TCO/km)** — Winner per business model with savings per km.
2. **Battery Longevity (SOH Degradation)** — Includes expandable derivation:
   - 8 calculation steps from route physics → P_mech → coefficients (A, B, C) → E_trip → EFC → Arrhenius k → power-law SOH
3. **Energy Efficiency (Wh/km)** — Includes expandable derivation:
   - Dynamic resistance → E_trip at end → Wh/km with Day 0 vs Day N comparison
4. **Capacity Fade (Ah)** — Includes expandable derivation:
   - C_remaining = 30 Ah × SOH with worked examples
5. **Cumulative TCO Accumulation** — Fleet-average per-bike costs + fleet total spend table:
   - Per-bike averages (fleet total ÷ 25) with daily burn rates
   - Total fleet spend table (all 25 bikes per model + grand total for 100 bikes)
   - Crossover point detection (where Owned overtakes BaaS)
   - Expandable mathematical derivation (OPEX, CAPEX, worked examples)
   - Expandable variance methodology (IEEE 754 precision, stochastic anxiety, min/max spread)

### 🏆 Overall Verdict

Best chemistry for Owned, best for BaaS, and overall most cost-effective path.

## Contributing

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes and test locally with `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Commit with descriptive messages: `git commit -m "Add: description of change"`
5. Push and open a Pull Request.

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 conventions.
- Add docstrings to all public functions.
- Keep UI code in `app.py` and logic in `workflow.py`.
- Use NumPy vectorisation over Python loops where possible.

### Areas for Contribution

- Additional battery chemistries (NMC, LTO).
- Multi-route simulation with route selection dropdown.
- Export simulation results to PDF/Excel reports.
- Database integration for historical run comparison.
- Unit tests for physics calculations.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openpyxl'`

Excel file support requires openpyxl:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

### `streamlit: command not found`

Use the Python module syntax:

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

### Files upload but nothing happens

- Ensure **all three files** (Driving Cycles, BMS Data, GPX) are uploaded before clicking **Perform ETL**.
- Check that your CSV/Excel files contain the expected column names (`user_id`, `start_date`, `distance_km`, `battery_id`, `cycle`, `SOH`, etc.).

### Simulation runs slowly

- Start with **40 days** instead of 120 for quick trend observation.
- The pre-computed energy coefficients should make 25-bike simulations run in under a second.

### GPX parsing errors

- Ensure the GPX file uses the standard namespace: `http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1`.
- Each `<trkpt>` must include `lat` and `lon` attributes. The `<ele>` tag is optional (defaults to 0.0).

### Charts show flat lines or no data

- Verify your BMS data contains records for battery IDs `B5`, `B6`, `B7` with `cycle > 0`.
- Verify your driving cycle data contains records for user IDs `579236`, `629227`, `629740`.

### CAPEX Amortized exceeds initial cost

- This was fixed: CAPEX amortization is now **capped at the initial battery price**. If you see values exceeding initial CAPEX, update to the latest `workflow.py`.
